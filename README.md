# Toronto_KSI-Killed-or-Serious-Injured-

This Killed or Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset is a subset from all traffic collision events. The source of the data comes from police reports where an officer attended an event related to a traffic collision. Please note that this dataset does not include all traffic collision events. The KSI data only includes events where a person sustained a major or fatal injury in a traffic collision event. The definitions included in Appendix B relate to the severity of injury used to classify the events in this dataset. Other injury types including minor or none are associated to every individual included in the event.

The KSI data includes a record (row) for every person involved in the collision event regardless of their level of injury, it includes everyone who was involved in a particular collision event. The field “Index” provides an arbitrary unique identification for every record in the entire dataset. The “ACCNUM” is a unique identification for each traffic collision event. Since the data includes every person involved in a collision event, this identification is duplicated. Please note that this number is not unique and it may repeat year over year. Careful consideration must be made when creating a subset for unique events, as the detailed information provided is for every person involved and its associated role and information may be lost.
